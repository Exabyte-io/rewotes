# Materials Designer (Frontend/UX)

> Ideal candidate: skilled front-end developer with UI/UX chops.

# Overview

Create a skeleton IDE (integrated development environment) for materials design, where one can change text and simultaneously see the visual result in another tab. We edit material in XYZ format and view result in 3D.

Front-end developers: use React.js and minimalistic UX/UI.

Pure UI/UX designers: create high fidelity mockups. 

# Requirements

1. Build a general layout with focus areas (eg. toolbar, structure viewer, source viewer)
2. Implement two edit modes:
   - source editor (to edit material in textual representation)
   - visual editor (to adjust material visual representation)
3. Support import  from a file format, (eg. POSCAR, XYZ)

# Expectations

1. up and running application OR high fidelity clickable mockups
2. general IDE layout (e.g. menu, toolboxes)
3. reactive material editor (edit material file → immediately see results on 3D representation)
4. clean and documented code
5. tests

# Timeline

We leave exact timing to the candidate. Must fit Within 5 days total.

# Notes

- use a designated github repo for version control and submission

# Examples

See [Materials Designer](https://github.com/Exabyte-io/materials-designer) repository also.

# Next.js README

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

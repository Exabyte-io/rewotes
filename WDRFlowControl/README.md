# Flowchart Designer
Developed starting Oct 10, 2022

## Overview

Create a drag-and-drop flowchart designer close to a basic programming flowchart editor that is purpose-built for dealing with certain types of data.

Front-end developers: use React.js and minimalistic UX/UI (database not required).

## Requirements

1. Implement basic arithmetic units as flowchart elements: 
   - [] increment, 
   - [] decrement, 
   - [] multiply, 
   - [] divide
1. Implement conditions (diamonds)
1. Implement 2 viewer components:
    - [] flowchart
    - [] underlying data structure (JSON)
1. Make JSON data structure to update reactively based on flowchart content

## Expectations

1. up and running application
1. drag-and-drop flowchart builder with support for basic arithmetics
1. clean and documented code
1. tests

### Timeline

We leave exact timing to the candidate. Must fit Within 5 days total.

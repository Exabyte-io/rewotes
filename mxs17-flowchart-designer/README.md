The project implements a basic flowchart editor with a viewer for created expression ASTs in a JSON format.

Available operations:

- To add a block, drag and drop it from the palette into the editor area. You can rearrange the chart by moving the interconnected blocks.
- To remove a block, drag and drop it back to the palette.
- To draw a line between blocks, click the connection point and drag your mouse to the connection point of the second block.
- To change an operand (numeric 0-9 or boolean T/F), double click the block and type a number (2 digits) or T/F (true/false). To complete editing, click outside the block.

The flowchart is persisted to the local storage. To remove the created flowchart, press the Reset button.

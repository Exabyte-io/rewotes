Scenario: Doping Process Optimization for a Silicon Semiconductor

In the semiconductor manufacturing process, achieving the desired electrical conductivity is crucial. The conductivity is primarily determined by the number and type of dopants added to the intrinsic semiconductor.

Doping refers to the introduction of impurities into an intrinsic semiconductor, altering its electrical properties. The added impurity atoms can provide free carriers, making the material either n-type (extra electrons) or p-type (missing electrons, or "holes"). Adjusting the doping concentration is the primary method of influencing the conductivity of the semiconductor.

After each doping cycle, a sample wafer is tested to measure its electrical conductivity.
Depending on the semiconductor's intended use, there's a target range for optimal conductivity. For instance, for high-speed electronics, a higher conductivity might be desired.
If the measured conductivity is outside this optimal range, adjustments are made to the doping concentration.

If the post-doping conductivity check reveals that the conductivity is lower than desired, the doping concentration can be increased in the next batch. This implies adding more dopant atoms to each wafer, which will introduce more charge carriers and thus increase conductivity.
Conversely, if the conductivity is too high or if there are too many charge carriers causing other undesired effects (like increased heat generation), the doping concentration can be reduced in the next batch.

As confidence in the doping process grows and the desired conductivity is consistently achieved, the production can be scaled up to process more wafers at once. This is especially useful when ramping up for large-scale manufacturing or meeting increased demand.

In scenarios where there are uncertainties, such as introducing a new doping agent or changing equipment, it might be prudent to reduce the batch size. This minimizes risk and waste if the batch doesn't achieve the desired results.

The conductivity (σ) of a material can be measured using the formula:
σ=n×q×μ

Where:
n = number of charge carriers per unit volume
q = charge of a carrier (for an electron: 1.6×10−19 Coulombs)
μ = mobility of the charge carrier (this varies depending on the type of doping and the dopant concentration)

Goal: Achieve a specific electrical conductivity in the semiconductor by adjusting the doping concentration

Assumptions:

- Process involves batch processing of silicon wafers.

Example:

1. Start with a certain batch of intrinsic Silicon wafers and doping concentration.

2. Apply the doping process.

3. Check the conductivity of a sample wafer from the batch.

4. If the conductivity is not optimal, adjust the doping concentration (INCREMENT or DECREMENT) and potentially reduce the batch size (DIVIDE) to minimize risks in the next run.

5. If the conductivity is optimal, decide to either maintain the batch size or scale up the production.

6. Optionally, Multiply or Divide the batch size based on production needs and repeat the process for the new batch size.

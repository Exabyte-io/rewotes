# Flowchart Designer (Frontend/UX)

> Ideal candidate: skilled front-end developer with UI/UX chops.

# Overview

Create a drag-and-drop flowchart designer close to a basic programming flowchart editor that is purpose-built for dealing with certain types of data.

Front-end developers: use Meteor and React.js and minimalistic UX/UI.
Pure UI/UX designers: create high fidelity mockups.Â 

# Requirements

1. Implement basic arithmetic units as flowchart elements: increment, decrement, multiply, divide
1. Implement conditions
1. Implement 2 viewer components:
    - flowchart
    - underlying data structure (JSON)
1. Make JSON data structure to update reactively based on flowchart content

# Expectations

1. up and running application OR high fidelity clickable mockups
1. drag-and-drop flowchart builder with support for basic arithmetics
1. clean and documented code
1. tests

# Timeline

We leave exact timing to the candidate. Must fit Within 5 days total.

# Notes

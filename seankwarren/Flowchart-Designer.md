# Flowchart Calculator

Flowchart Calculator is a Meteor/React application that allows users to create flowcharts representing mathematical operations, functions, and logical comparisons. It's built using React, Meteor, and MongoDB and the React Flow library.

### Features

- Drag and drop interface for adding nodes to the flowchart
- Live calculation and display of results
- Support for arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, ^), functions (sin, cos, tan, exp), and logical comparisons (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=)
- View real-time syntax-highlighted JSON representation of nodes and edges
- Interactive flowchart editor powered by React Flow
- Support for saving and loading flowcharts
- Dark mode ðŸŽ‰

### Usage

- Drag and drop a custom node (input, operation, comparison, or output) from the buttons panel onto the flowchart area.
- Connect nodes using the handles on each node. Ensure to connect the output handle of one node to the input handle of another.
- Edit input nodes or operation/comparison nodes to see the updated output values in the output nodes.
- View the JSON representation of nodes and edges in the right pane.
- Name and save flowcharts and reload them

### Setup

Install dependencies using `npm install`.

Run the development server using `meteor`.
> will launch on <a href="http://localhost:3000/">localhost:3000/</a>

### Complete User Stories:
- [x] As an end user, I should be able to perform calculations using these 4 binary operators (+, -, *, /) and 6 comparison operators (<, >, >=, <=, ==, !=).
- [x] As an end user, when I operate on two values, I should be able to read the output as a number in an output node.
- [x] As an end user, when I compare two values, I should be able to read the output as 'true' or 'false' in an output node.
- [x] As an end user, when I operate on or compare two values, the top-most edge should always come first in the operation. e.g $3\over4$ vs $4\over3$
- [x] As an end user, when I add any nodes or edges, the results in all output nodes should update.
- [x] As an end user, the result should update on any change to the input values or selected operators that I make.
- [x] As an end user, I should be able to construct flowcharts of arbitrary depth and number of output cells.
- [x] As an end user, I should be able to drag desired nodes onto the flowchart, and they should be placed at the dropped position.
- [x] As an end user, I should be able to edit the flowchart and have the JSON update accordingly.
- [x] As an end user, I should be able to use common unary operators such as sin, cos, tan, and e<sup>x</sup>.
- [x] As an end user, I should be able to use the y<sup>x</sup> binary operator, that takes two inputs and calculates the exponential.
- [x] As an end user, node types should be quickly and easily distinguished by shape and color.
- [x] As an end user, I should see some nodes on screen when I launch the application that explain how to use the app.
- [x] As an end user, I should be able to easily read the JSON representation with syntax highlighting.
- [x] As an end user, I should be able to click a 'Save Flow' button to save the JSON datastructure to a MongoDB instance.
- [x] As an end user, I should be able to select a saved flow from a dropdown list and load it in the flowchart and JSON viewers.

### Potential Improvement User Stories:
- [ ] ~~As an end user, I should be able to edit the JSON and have the flowchart update accordingly.~~
- [ ] ~~As an end user, I should be able to use the comparison nodes as a gate to decide whether another node should be executed.~~
- [ ] ~~As an end user, the input nodes should be exapandable to include multiple values each with their own handle.~~
- [ ] As an end user, I should be able to click on a button called 'clear' to clear the flowchart.
- [ ] ~~As an end user, I should be able to click on a button called 'restore' to put the previously clear flowchart back in place.~~

# Flowchart Calculator

Flowchart Calculator is a Meteor/React application that allows users to create flowcharts representing mathematical operations, functions, and logical comparisons. It's built using React, Meteor, and MongoDB and the React Flow library.

## Features

- Drag and drop interface for adding nodes to the flowchart
- Live calculation and display of results
- Support for arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, ^), functions (sin, cos, tan, exp), and logical comparisons (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=)
- View real-time syntax-highlighted JSON representation of nodes and edges
- Interactive flowchart editor powered by React Flow
- Support for saving and loading flowcharts
- Dark mode ðŸŽ‰

## Usage

- Drag and drop a custom node (input, operation, comparison, or output) from the buttons panel onto the flowchart area.
- Connect nodes using the handles on each node. Ensure to connect the output handle of one node to the input handle of another.
- Edit input nodes or operation/comparison nodes to see the updated output values in the output nodes.
- View the JSON representation of nodes and edges in the right pane.
- Name and save flowcharts and reload them

## Setup

Install dependencies using `npm install`.

Run the development server using `meteor`.
> will launch on <a href="http://localhost:3000/">localhost:3000/</a>

Run tests with `npm run cypress:open`

# Materials Designer (Frontend/UX)

> Ideal candidate: skilled front-end developer with UI/UX chops.

# Overview

Create a skeleton IDE (integrated development environment) for materials design. Close to Adobe Dreamweaver (or any other IDE) - when you can change html-markup and simultaneously see the result in another tab. We edit material in XYZ format and view result in 3D.

Front-end developers: use Meteor and React.js and minimalistic UX/UI.

Pure UI/UX designers: create high fidelity mockups. 

# Requirements

1. Build a general layout with focus areas (eg. toolbar, structure viewer, source viewer)
2. Implement two edit modes:
   - source editor (to edit material in textual representation)
   - visual editor (to adjust material visual representation)
3. Support import  from a file format, (eg. POSCAR, XYZ)

# Expectations

1. up and running application OR high fidelity clickable mockups
2. general IDE layout (e.g. menu, toolboxes)
3. reactive material editor (edit material file → immediately see results on 3D representation)
4. clean and documented code
5. tests

# Timeline

We leave exact timing to the candidate. Must fit Within 5 days total.

# Notes

- use a designated github repo for version control and submission

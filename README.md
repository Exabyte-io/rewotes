## Usage

We suggest the following flow:

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) this repository on GitHub
2. Create a branch using your GitHub username as a branch name
3. Create a subfolder with your GitHub username
4. Copy one of the ReWoTe suggestions (`.md` files) to `README.md` in that subfolder and modify the content of the ReWoTe as necessary
5. Introduce any changes under the subfolder
6. Submit a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) into the `dev` branch of this repository

See [dev branch](https://github.com/Exabyte-io/rewotes/tree/dev) also.

## Notes

The examples listed here are only meant as guidelines and do not necessarily reflect the type of work to be performed at the company. Modifications to the individual assignments with advance notice are encouraged.

We will screen for the ability to:

1. pick up new concepts quickly
2. explain one's thoughts and process
3. implement a working proof-of-concept solution.

We value attention to detail and modularity.

## Who we look for

We look for people who:

1. Think like founders or want to be founders in the future, want to join a company at a very early stage, and understand the risk vs reward ratio.
2. Can learn quickly and have demonstrated it in the past. Advanced degrees help with this, but not a requirement.
3. Know their $hit and have measurable ways to prove it. Here, we can, for example, look at GitHub profiles (and compare with https://github.com/timurbazhirov), a list of publications (and compare with https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7SxfHbMAAAAJ), writing skills, and the ability to consume technical knowledge.
4. Are honest and energetic.

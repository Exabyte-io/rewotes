# Instructions

BasisSetSelector can be used as python module, or as command line script `optimize_basis`. In either case, setting up the calculation is primarily done using properly formatted .json files. These examples assume NWChem is installed on your machine.

Working examples:

```bash
  # python script
  python example.py
  # command line script
  optimize_basis ex1.json b3lyp 0.1 --verbose
```

Forked repo, set up directories.
Established rough architecture.
Familiarized myself with running calculations on mat3ra using a Jupyter notebook.
- Use of the RESTful API is taking some getting used to, as is running calculations
  through a platform, rather than directly on a HPC system.
- Managed to get an energy for Si2.
- Managed to adapt code to run TiO2.
? Still unclear how exactly k-point grids are chosen using the current workflow. 
  I suspect is has something to do with context.
? I am still debating using explicit pw.in files to run jobs. This may not really
  make much sense, as context is important (e.g. JOB_WORK_DIR)
? Encountering some strange behavior on mat3ra.com When applying a workflow
  to a new material, the old material (and pw.in) is displayed for some time...

After more thought, using explicit pw.in files offers the most flexibility to the 
end user. To do this, I will replace 'content' in the default workflow with the desired
pw.in. This failed. Jobs gave an error, but could not access error info on the web app! Makes debugging very difficult...maybe there's an API? Submitted again through the web interface, error information this time was available...weird. Calculation is failing is strange ways, no pseudopotential files are generated on AWS. Hm.

The error was in my pw.in file. This file is a template, therefore the directory
parameters should have been surrounded by {% raw %} tags. Fixing this, I can now run calculations with a (nearly) explicit pw.in file.

So far, all jobs have contained a material. With an explicit pw.in file, there is no guarantee that the material is in Mat3ra. For now, I'll try running a job without an associated material. The job is successful, though the web interface seems to break? Still, using the API, I can extract an energy.

I can now run quantum espresso calculations on Mat3ra based on a template pw.in file. to make this work, I create a workflow for each pw.in template. This is not ideal - perhaps there's a way to create a workflow that uses a pw.in file as an input. However, for the purposes of creating a working prototype, I'm happy enough with this solution.

Started implementation. Going well so far. Wait times for calculations increased (maybe under maintenance), so will return tomorrow.
